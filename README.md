This project was developed in an Operating Systems class.

The objective of the program is to emulate a simplified operating system, featuring a memory manager, a process manager, and a CPU scheduler.

When run in debug mode, it is possible to observe the CPU executing each opcode step by step. You can also see how the system handles process switching, interruptions, and system calls in real time.

The emulator demonstrates core OS concepts such as process state transitions, context switching, and interrupt handling, providing an understanding of how an operating system works.
